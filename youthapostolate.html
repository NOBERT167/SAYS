              <p>Youth called to Holy Orders of priesthood or sisterhood.VIJANA NA WITO ASSOCIATION(VIWA)
                  Vijana na Wito Association (VIWA) is a vocations-geared component of the youth fraternity of the Catholic Diocese of Kericho. It is composed of youths who have completed their high school, in university or college or tertiary institutions levels of education, and even those who have completed their higher education. This body was formed during the chaplaincy of Rev,Fr Moses Langat, the current Diocesan Youth Chaplain and Vocations Director.
                  The VIWA members are of both genders, and the main aim of this spiritual body is to identify, nurture, and grow vocations amongst their member youths.
                  Members meet regularly for Masses at least twice a year and attend vocations-oriented seminars and workshops organized by the Diocesan Vocations Department.
                  Member youth are united under the common call to serve and evangelize to all people, and the preparation towards a life spent in this service under the religious life is the central spirit of this youthful body.

                      <h4>St. Augustine of Hippo</h4>
                  <p>Biography and significance of St. Augustine of Hippo.Saint Augustine was born in 354 AD in a small town called Thagaste, in
                      what is now Algeria. His early life was pretty wild and far from what we might think of as "saintly.” He was intelligent, curious, and like many of us, he questioned a lot of things, especially when it came to faith.
                      
                      Growing up, Augustine was more interested in parties and worldly
                      pleasures than in prayer and church. He searched for happiness in all the wrong places, including partying and philosophy. He even joining a
                      cult-like group called the Manichees. Despite his mother's (Saint Monica’s) prayers and tears, Augustine strayed far from the faith.
                      
                      But here’s where things get interesting: Augustine’s story takes a
                      major twist when he encounters the writings of Saint Paul and hears
                      the powerful preaching of Saint Ambrose in Milan. These experiences
                      led him to realize that the joy he sought in worldly things was fleeting and shallow.
                      
                      One day, in a moment of despair, Augustine heard a child’s voice saying, “Take up and read.” He picked up a Bible and read a passage from Romans that spoke to his heart. This was his turning point.
                      Augustine converted to Christianity, was baptized by Saint Ambrose, and eventually became a bishop, a theologian, and one of the Church's greatest saints.
                      
                      Just like Augustine, many of us grapple with questions about life, faith, and our purpose. Augustine’s journey from doubt to faith shows us that it’s okay to question and seek. It's part of growing and finding genuine faith.
                      
                      Augustine’s early life was full of temptations and mistakes. He reminds us that even saints had their struggles. What’s important is not our past, but our willingness to turn back to God and seek forgiveness in the sacrament of reconciliation. It’s never too late to turn back to God. No matter how far we’ve strayed, God’s grace is always there, waiting for us to take the next step towards Him.
                      
                      Augustine’s mother, Saint Monica, never gave up on him. Her prayers and love were instrumental in his conversion. This is a beautiful reminder of the power of prayer and the importance of not giving up on those we love.
                      
                      In his famous work " Confessions"  , Augustine wrote, “Our hearts are restless until they rest in You, O Lord.” This speaks volumes about the nature of true happiness. Real joy and peace are found in God, not in the temporary thrills of the world.
                      
                      Stay blessed, keep seeking, and remember: even if you’re feeling a bit
                      lost now, there’s a saintly path ahead, just waiting for you to discover it.
